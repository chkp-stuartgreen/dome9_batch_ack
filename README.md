# Dome9: Batch Alert Acknowledgement

## A simple script to acknowledge all of your Dome9 alerts.

If you find that you've been a little lax in acknowledging your Dome9 alerts, this script will allow you batch acknowledge all of your alerts. While this won't delete them from your console - it will set them to acknowledged and that will allow you to save a preset filter to not show acknowledged alerts.

## Usage

All you need is a Dome9 API ID and Secret, add these to the relevant places at the top of the script and then run! Please log any issues here.
